Hey there! My name is Nao and I am a digital designer with a focus on web and motion graphics. 

I thrive in open-minded environments where I can let my creativity flow. As a detail-oriented designer, I strive to perfect my craft and deliver high-quality work every time. I am always open to new opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals and forward-thinking brands.
