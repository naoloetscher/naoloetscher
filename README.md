👋🏼 Hey, I’m Nao

I’m a Gen-Z Designer exploring the big world of design and creative work. 

---

I like to play with motion graphics, videos and websites.

For me creative freedom is very important. I like to work with open minded people and brands. I love to perfect my craft down to the smallest details.
